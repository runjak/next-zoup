# next-zoup

Toying around with the [zoup spec](https://github.com/zoupio/spec) to see where that may lead.

The idea is the following:

I want to use Next.js and Typescript to build an implementation of the given [spec.md](https://github.com/zoupio/spec/blob/main/spec.md) to get some insight into how that spec behaves and to get a rough idea of the work required to get it running.

The first prototype shall keep all state in local files in the hope that this will aid development and setup and be an ok starting point. It should always be possible to add more complexity and dependencies later.
