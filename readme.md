# next-zoup

Toying around with the [zoup spec](https://github.com/zoupio/spec) to see where that may lead.

The idea is the following:

I want to use Next.js and Typescript to build an implementation of the given [spec.md](https://github.com/zoupio/spec/blob/main/spec.md) to get some insight into how that spec behaves and to get a rough idea of the work required to get it running.

The first prototype shall keep all state in local files in the hope that this will aid development and setup and be an ok starting point. It should always be possible to add more complexity and dependencies later.

## setup and scripts

This project uses [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
If you've got node installed on your machine chances are you're good to go.

Execute `yarn install` to locally install the node dependencies into the `node_modules` directory.
Afterwards execute `yarn dev` to run a development server at `localhost:3000`.

For production the project is first built using `yarn build` and afterwards executed with `yarn start`.

The linter is executed with `yarn lint`.

### environment variables

Some configuration is done via environment variables.
In addition to the environment these can be set via a `.env.local` file.
The checked in file `.env.example` contains example values and lists all used environment variables.

## user handling

For the prototype user handling is currently realized as follows:

User data is stored in `data/users/<username>.json`.
We save at least a name and a salted bcrypt hash of a password.
User login is based on this password and there is currently no way to support users in resetting their passwords.

User registration depends on invite keys.
An initial invite key needs to be configured via the `INITIAL_INVITE_KEY` environment variable.
It is intended that users can create further invite keys.
The idea behind this is to support some organic tradeoff between (somewhat unlikely) but possible growth and enabling users to self-register.
As there are currently no means to support any kind of moderation it seemed helpful to have some mechanism like this for people sharing a prototypical server.
